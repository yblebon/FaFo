Curreent context:
- in St Pierre, La Reunion, backpacking
- discovering the island
- some issues in 8 months and slept few times on the street

Questions:
- rainy season, someone gave me a blanket and couldnt refuse or an excuse to call the environment police?
- some nice movies apparently on the cinema nowdays, just wondering what people would think about that bakcpack with me?
